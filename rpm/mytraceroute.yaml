Description: |
    mtr combines the functionality of the 'traceroute' and 'ping' programs in a
    single network diagnostic tool.
    
    As mtr starts, it investigates the network connection between the host mtr runs
    on and a user-specified destination host. After it determines the address of
    each network hop between the machines, it sends a sequence of ICMP ECHO
    requests to each one to determine the quality of the link to each machine. As
    it does this, it prints running statistics about each machine.
